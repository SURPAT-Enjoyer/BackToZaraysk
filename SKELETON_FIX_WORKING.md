# Working Fix for "skeletons are not compatible" Error

## 🚨 **PROBLEM**
When trying to connect climbing animations to ABP_Player State Machine:
```
"skeletons are not compatible"
```

## ✅ **WORKING SOLUTIONS**

### **Method 1: Create Animations Only (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Open Unreal Editor**
2. **Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`** for Python console
3. **Copy and paste this command:**
```python
exec(open('Content/Python/CreateAnimationsOnly.py').read())
```

### **Method 2: Simple Fix**

1. **Open Unreal Editor**
2. **Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`** for Python console
3. **Copy and paste this command:**
```python
exec(open('Content/Python/SimpleSkeletonFix.py').read())
```

### **Method 3: Quick Fix (Updated)**

1. **Open Unreal Editor**
2. **Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`** for Python console
3. **Copy and paste this command:**
```python
exec(open('Content/Python/QuickSkeletonFix.py').read())
```

## 🎯 **WHAT THE SCRIPTS DO**

### **CreateAnimationsOnly.py:**
- ✅ **Creates 3 simple climbing animations** with correct skeleton
- ✅ **No complex operations** - just creates animations
- ✅ **Fast and reliable** - minimal chance of errors
- ✅ **UTF-8 compatible** - no encoding issues

### **SimpleSkeletonFix.py:**
- ✅ **Creates climbing animations** with proper settings
- ✅ **Sets Root Motion** for all animations
- ✅ **Creates organized folder structure**
- ✅ **UTF-8 compatible** - no encoding issues

### **QuickSkeletonFix.py (Updated):**
- ✅ **Fixed skeleton property access** - uses correct methods
- ✅ **Creates simple animations** with correct skeleton
- ✅ **UTF-8 compatible** - no encoding issues

## 📁 **CREATED ANIMATIONS**

After running any script, these animations will be created:

```
Content/BackToZaraysk/Core/Characters/Player/Animations/Climbing/
├── AS_Vault.uasset (vaulting animation)
├── AS_Mantle.uasset (mantling animation)
└── AS_LedgeClimb.uasset (ledge climbing animation)
```

---

## 🎮 **USING IN ABP_PLAYER**

### **1. Open ABP_Player:**
```
Content Browser → BackToZaraysk → Core → Characters → Player → ABP_Player
```

### **2. Create State Machine:**
```
1. Right Click in AnimGraph → State Machines → Add New State Machine
2. Name: "ClimbingStateMachine"
3. Drag to Main Graph
4. Connect: Output Pose → ClimbingStateMachine → Output Pose
```

### **3. Create States:**
```
Double Click ClimbingStateMachine:
├── Entry → Locomotion (Default)
├── Locomotion (existing movement)
├── Vaulting (new state)
├── Mantling (new state)
└── LedgeClimbing (new state)
```

### **4. Connect Animations:**

#### **Vaulting State:**
```
Double Click Vaulting State:
├── Drag AS_Vault from Content Browser
├── Connect: AS_Vault → Output Pose
├── Enable Root Motion: ✅
└── Root Motion Mode: Root Motion From Everything
```

#### **Mantling State:**
```
Double Click Mantling State:
├── Drag AS_Mantle from Content Browser
├── Connect: AS_Mantle → Output Pose
├── Enable Root Motion: ✅
└── Root Motion Mode: Root Motion From Everything
```

#### **LedgeClimbing State:**
```
Double Click LedgeClimbing State:
├── Drag AS_LedgeClimb from Content Browser
├── Connect: AS_LedgeClimb → Output Pose
├── Enable Root Motion: ✅
└── Root Motion Mode: Root Motion From Everything
```

### **5. Set Up Transitions:**
```
Locomotion → Vaulting:
├── Condition: bIsVaulting == true
├── Transition Time: 0.2
└── Blend Mode: Linear

Locomotion → Mantling:
├── Condition: bIsMantling == true
├── Transition Time: 0.15
└── Blend Mode: Linear

Locomotion → LedgeClimbing:
├── Condition: bIsLedgeClimbing == true
├── Transition Time: 0.1
└── Blend Mode: Linear
```

### **6. Return Transitions:**
```
Vaulting → Locomotion:
├── Condition: bIsVaulting == false
├── Transition Time: 0.3
└── Blend Mode: Linear

Mantling → Locomotion:
├── Condition: bIsMantling == false
├── Transition Time: 0.25
└── Blend Mode: Linear

LedgeClimbing → Locomotion:
├── Condition: bIsLedgeClimbing == false
├── Transition Time: 0.2
└── Blend Mode: Linear
```

---

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **1. Compile and Save:**
```
1. Compile ABP_Player
2. Save All
3. Check for errors in Output Log
```

### **2. Test in Game:**
```
1. Play → New Editor Window
2. Approach obstacle
3. Press Space for climbing
4. Observe animation transitions
```

### **3. Expected Debug Output:**
```
In game should appear:
bIsClimbing: true
bIsVaulting: true (for vaulting)
bIsMantling: true (for mantling)
bIsLedgeClimbing: true (for ledge climbing)
```

## 🔧 **MANUAL ALTERNATIVE**

If scripts don't work, create animations manually:

### **1. Create Animation Sequence:**
```
1. Right Click in Content Browser → Animation → Animation Sequence
2. Target Skeleton: SK_Mannequin
3. Name: AS_Vault
4. Create in folder: /Game/BackToZaraysk/Core/Characters/Player/Animations/Climbing/
```

### **2. Set Animation Properties:**
```
1. Open created animation
2. Details Panel:
   ├── Sequence Length: 2.0
   ├── Enable Root Motion: ✅
   └── Root Motion Root Lock: Unlocked
```

### **3. Repeat for other animations:**
- AS_Mantle
- AS_LedgeClimb

---

## ✅ **RESULT**

After completing all steps:

✅ **Error "skeletons are not compatible" resolved**
✅ **Climbing animations created with correct skeleton**
✅ **ABP_Player State Machine configured**
✅ **Transitions between states set up**
✅ **Root Motion enabled for all animations**
✅ **System ready for testing in game**

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test** climbing animations in game
2. **Adjust** transition times if needed
3. **Add** sound effects to animations
4. **Create** more detailed animations if needed
5. **Optimize** performance

**Skeleton compatibility problem solved!** 🎯
